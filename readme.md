# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project is a web-based application for recognizing handwritten digits in real-time. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to accurately predict digits drawn by the user on a canvas. The project combines the power of machine learning with a user-friendly web interface to deliver an intuitive experience.

## Features
- **Real-time Prediction:** Draw a digit on the canvas and get instant predictions.
- **Simple and Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface with clear buttons for drawing, clearing, and predicting.
- **Accurate Model:** Trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
